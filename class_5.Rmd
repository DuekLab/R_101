## Introduction to Working with Data Frames in R

Data frames are crucial data structures in R, similar to tables in databases, which allow storing data in rows and columns.

## Tasks in Working with Data Frames

### Filtering, Merging, Sorting, and Reshaping Data Frames

Working with data frames involves several key tasks:

-   Filtering data to select specific rows based on conditions.
-   Merging data from different sources.
-   Sorting data based on values in one or more columns.
-   Reshaping data frames to change their structure.

## Useful Functions for Data Frames

Using basic R functions and `tidyverse` functions can significantly enhance data manipulation tasks. ![Alt text](tidyverse_image.png){width=400}

## Tidyverse Packages Overview

`tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science tasks, making data manipulation, visualization, and analysis more convenient.

## Filtering Rows and Columns in Data Frames

### Row Filtering

Using `filter()` and `slice()` functions to select rows based on specific criteria.

```{r}
# lets grab the weight-height data set and filter only men
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

## Using it

```{r}
df <- read.csv('Weight and Height.csv')
# using tydiverse pipeline
df %>% filter(What.is.you.gender == 'Male') 
```
## Fixing the names

```{r}
df <- df %>% clean_names()
names(df)
```


## Column Filtering
Using `select()` to choose columns based on their names or indices.

```{r}
# now lets select only height
df %>% select(what_is_your_height_in_cm) %>% summarise(mean= mean(what_is_your_height_in_cm),
                                                       sd = sd(what_is_your_height_in_cm))
```
```{r}
df %>% filter(what_is_you_gender=="Male") %>% select(what_is_your_height_in_cm, what_is_your_weight_in_kg) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(what_is_your_height_in_cm), 
            meanW = mean(what_is_your_weight_in_kg))
```
```{r}
df %>% filter(what_is_you_gender=="Female") %>% select(what_is_your_height_in_cm) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(what_is_your_height_in_cm))
```

## Combining Data Frames

Combining data from different sources using `inner_join`, `left_join`, `right_join`, and `full_join` functions.

```{r}
?left_join
df_age <- read.csv('age.csv')
df_iq <- read.csv('iq.csv')

df_both <- left_join(df_age, df_iq, by='id')
```


## Sorting Data Frames

Sorting data frames with `arrange()`, based on one or more variables.

```{r}
df_both %>% arrange(IQ)
```

## If I want descending order
```{r}
df_both %>% arrange(desc(IQ))
```
## Summarise rows
```{r}
df %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(weight_height = sum(what_is_your_height_in_cm + what_is_your_weight_in_kg))
```
## Using sum without rowwise()

```{r}
df %>% mutate(weight_height = sum(what_is_your_height_in_cm + what_is_your_weight_in_kg))
```

## Not using rowwise but without sum

```{r}
df %>% mutate(weight_height = what_is_your_height_in_cm + what_is_your_weight_in_kg)
```


## Summary by groups
```{r}
df %>% group_by(what_is_you_gender) %>% summarise(
  mean_height = mean(what_is_your_height_in_cm)
)
```


## Reshaping Data Frames

```{r}
#creating a wide dataframe
df_wide <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob"),
  Score_2021 = c(88, 92),
  Score_2022 = c(91, 95)
)

print(df_wide)
```

## Wide to Long Transformation
Using `pivot_longer()` to transform data from wide format to long format.

```{r}
df_long <- df_wide %>% pivot_longer(cols=c("Score_2021","Score_2022"))
```

## Setting new variable names
```{r}
df_long <- df_wide %>% pivot_longer(cols=c("Score_2021","Score_2022"),
                                  names_to = 'year', values_to = 'score')
```

## One last tyding
lets remove this Score_ from the data
```{r}
df_long <- df_wide %>% pivot_longer(cols=c("Score_2021","Score_2022"),
                                  names_to = 'year', values_to = 'score',
                                  names_prefix = 'Score_')
```

### Long to Wide Transformation
Using `pivot_wider()` to transform data from long format to wide format.
```{r}
dfw <- df_long %>% pivot_wider(names_from = year, 
                               values_from = score)
```


## The Concept of Tidy Data

Tidy data principles make it easier to manipulate and analyze data, where variables form columns, observations form rows, and each type of observational unit forms a table.
